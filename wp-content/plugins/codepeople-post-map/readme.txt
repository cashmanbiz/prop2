Note 1: To display all points that belong to a specific category, it is required to insert the following shortcode [codepeople-post-map cat="3"]. The number 3 represent the category ID, replace this number by the corresponding category's ID. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="3"]'); ?>
			
Note 2:	To display all points that belong to more than one category, separate the categories IDs with the comma symbol [codepeople-post-map cat="3,5"]. The numbers 3 y 5 are the categories IDs, replace these numbers by the corresponding categories IDs. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="3,5"]'); ?>
            
Note 3: To display all points in the website, use -1 as the category's ID: [codepeople-post-map cat="-1"] or  <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="-1"]'); ?> for template.

Note 4:	To display all points that belong to the posts with a specific tag assigned, for example the tag name "mytag", use the shortcode's attribute "tag", like follows: [codepeople-post-map tag="mytag"]. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map tag="mytag"]'); ?>
			
If you prefer configure your map directly from the shortcode, then you must enter an attribute for each map feature to specify. For example:
            
            [codepeople-post-map width="500" height="500"]

The complete list of allowed attributes are:

Very Important. Some of attributes are available only in the premium version of the plugin.
            
width:  Values allowed, number or percentage. Defines the map's width. [codepeople-post-map width="300"] or [codepeople-post-map width="100%"]

defaultpost: Defines the post ID, for centring the map, and display by default the infowindow corresponding to the first point associated to this post. [codepeople-post-map defaultpost="396"]

legend:  Accepts a taxonomy name as value. Some common taxonomies names are:  category and post_tag, for the categories and tags, respectively. Displays the legend with the list of elements that belong to the taxonomy and are assigned to the posts associated with the points. [codepeople-post-map legend="category"]

legend_title:  Text to be used as legend title. [codepeople-post-map legend="category" legend_title="Select the categories to display on map"]

legend_class:  Class name to be assigned to the legend. The legend design may be modified through CSS styles.

[codepeople-post-map legend="category" legend_class="my-legend-class"]

tag:  Tags slugs separated by ",". Displays on map the points whose posts have assigned the tags.[codepeople-post-map tag="tag1,tag2,tag3"]

cat:  Categories IDs separated by "," or -1. Displays on map the points whose posts belong to the categories. The special value -1, allows display on map all points defined in the website.[codepeople-post-map cat="2,4,56"] [codepeople-post-map cat="-1"]

excludepost:  Posts IDs to exclude separated by ",". [codepeople-post-map cat="-1" excludepost="235,260"]

excludetag:  Tags IDs to exclude separated by ",". [codepeople-post-map excludetag="2,13"]

taxonomy:  The taxonomy is a special attribute that should be combined with other attributes, depending of taxonomies to use for points filtering. Suppose the website includes two new taxonomies:  taxonomyA and taxonomyB, and the map should display all points that belong to the posts with the value T1 for taxonomyA, and T3,T4 for taxonomyB, the shortcode would be:  [codepeople-post-map taxonomy="taxonomyA,taxonomyB" taxonomyA="T1" taxonomyB="t2,t3"]

Note 5: The geolocation information is stored in image's metadata from mobiles or cameras with GPS devices.

Note 6: Some plugins interfere with the shortcodes replacements, and provokes that maps don't be loaded correctly, in this case should be passed a new parameter through the shortcode print=1

Passing the parameter print=1, displays the map at beginning of page/post content.

Note 7: To display all points in posts with a specific taxonomy assigned, or multiple taxonomies, should be used the "taxonomy" attribute in the shortcode, with the list of all taxonomies separated by the comma symbol, for example: taxonomy="taxonomy1,taxonomy2", and a new attribute for each taxonomy with the values corresponding. For example if you want select the points that belong to the posts with the values: "value1" for "taxonomy1", the shortcode would be: [codepeople-post-map taxonomy="taxonomy1" taxonomy1="value1"], for multiple taxonomies: [codepeople-post-map taxonomy="taxonomy1,taxonomy2" taxonomy1="value1" taxonomy2="value2,value3"].
